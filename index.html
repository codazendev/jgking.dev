                    <strong>Travelling with Taste:</strong> A 3D
                    puzzle-platformer where you play as a bunch of rats in a
                    suitcase. Your goal is to navigate an airport baggage
                    handling area and make it to the plane before it takes off!
                    Along the way you must avoid sinister security guards and
                    collect as much cheese as you can. Developed in Unreal
                    Engine over the course of seven weeks in collaboration with
                    seven total team members.
